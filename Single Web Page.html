        <p>Nothing has been as contested whether they’re beneficial or not as much as video games. Ever since they’ve been invented, video games have always been under fire for allegedly corrupting the kids who enjoy playing them.</p>

        <p>Most of these complaints come from worried parents and well-meaning organizations that simply don’t want their children to be exposed to something dangerous.</p>

        <p>But contrary to these accusations, science has constantly shown favor to video games. Studies from cognitive psychology and brain research have shown that a moderate amount of playing video games hosts several advantages. When used the right way, games are beneficial to kids and adults, no matter what age.</p>
        
        <h1 id="Benefits"> Benefits </h1>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="benefits">1. Video games strengthen your memory and attention.</span>
                <img src="images/1.jpg" class="benefit-image" alt="">
                <p>Immersive gameplays require you to remember details to progress smoothly in the game, with different sources like texts, visuals, and audio having to be considered simultaneously. Video games condition the mind and improve its capability to store and remember information, both short-term and long-term.</p>
            </li>

            <li><span class="benefits">2. Video games enhance your brain’s speed and flexibility.</span>
                <img src="images/2.jpg" class="benefit-image" alt="">
                <p>Because everything happens so fast in a video game, your brain is also trained to process information quickly. Individuals who play video games frequently were found to process different stimuli faster than others, while still making smart decisions to accomplish the goal.</p>
            </li>

            <li><span class="benefits">3. Video games improve your hand-eye coordination.</span>
                <img src="images/3.jpeg" class="benefit-image" alt="">
                <p>Hand-eye coordination is one of the foundations of being a good video game player, and playing specific games can further improve this skill. Video games harmonize your eye movement with your hand movement to allow you to react quickly and accurately. This is true for video games of any genre, but it’s especially true for active video games like Wii Sports and Kinect Adventures.</p>
            </li>

            <li><span class="benefits">4. Video games can help you form bonds and become more social.</span>
                <img src="images/4.jpg" class="benefit-image" alt="">
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, a healthy dose of video games does not make children (nor adults) anti-social. Because many games are online and social in nature, they can help you develop sportsmanship and a friendly attitude.</p>
            </li>

            <li><span class="benefits">5. Video games are a great platform for learning.</span>
                <img src="images/5.jpeg" class="benefit-image" alt="">
                <p>Aside from the games that were specifically designed to be educational, a lot of games impart knowledge and relevant skills while not being explicitly made for learning. Historical games that are inspired by real-life events like Assassin’s Creed or Civilization are great starting points for gamers to be interested in history. Sci-fi games like BioShock and Half-Life introduce physics concepts that, while comically exaggerated, are based on real science. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="Conclusion"> Conclusion </h1>

        <p class="quote">Remember, too much of anything is bad for you. With all of these wonderful benefits that you can get from playing video games, it’s tempting to say that playing 10 hours straight is okay since you’re getting all of the good stuff, right? Not really. Much like everything in excess, too much video games tend to counteract the pros and instead become detrimental to your physical, mental, and social health.</p>

        <p>To fully reap the benefits of video games, they must be consumed healthily and moderately. Additionally, selecting the appropriate video games is also important, because not all games offer the same cognitive benefits. Some online games may also not be suitable for younger and sensitive audiences.</p>

        <p class="note">Who knew that by playing our favorite video games, we are also unknowingly sharpening our minds and developing skills that prepare us for the real world? Most of us don’t give games enough credit, but science shows us that they are valuable platforms for both learning and entertainment. As long as they are used wisely and healthily, there is no harm in playing another round of Mario Kart with your friends.</p>
